 Power BI Dashboard – Insurance Claims & Coverage Analysis 

I’m excited to share that I’ve just completed my first Power BI project, where I independently analyzed and visualized a dataset of 1,000 insurance claims. It’s a small step, but a significant one in my journey into the world of data analytics! 📈

What I Did
The dataset included 40 variables grouped into:

Insured person details
Policy information
Incident descriptions
Vehicle characteristics

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard to explore:

 Number of claims processed and total amount approved across different states
 Impact of gender, time, and vehicle age on reported incidents
 Patterns in fraudulent claims

Key Learnings from This Project:

Data modeling
Power Query transformations
Designing interactive visuals
Extracting insights from messy, real-world data
